Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare two lists amount_spent=[], item_type=[] to store the
amount spent and item category respectively.
Step 3: To take the target amount, declare a variable called
target_amount and take its input from the user.
Step 4: Display the various categories of money spending using print
statements.
Step 5: To get the number of items purchased by their categories use
another variable called number_items and enter the number.
Step 6: Using a for loop we will take input from the user and store its
values in a and b variables.
Step 7: Using append() we will insert elements to the lists.
Step 8: Calculate the total amount spent in the month using the sum().
Step 9: Display the information using print statements.
Step 10: On comparing the target amount and the total spent amount
we will display the money spent status of the user. The status
statements will be:
if(total_spent==target_amount):
 print("This Month Target Amount Reached.")
 print("Well Done! Continue keeping the Target.")
elif(total_spent>target_amount):
 print("This Month Target Amount is Crossed")
 print("Please Refrain to unnecessary Expenses")
else:
 print("This Month Target Amount is Kept")
 print("Well Done! Try to Keep up the track")
Step 11: Plot a graph using the information entered by the user. The
graph will be created by using matplotlib.pyplot library.
Step 12: Stop
